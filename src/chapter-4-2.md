**3. Role of Mentoring in Agile**

Mentoring plays a vital role in supporting individuals' growth, development, and learning within Agile organizations. Mentors provide guidance, share their knowledge and experiences, and act as trusted advisors to mentees as they navigate their Agile journey.

Key aspects of mentoring in Agile include:

Several coaching and mentoring frameworks can be leveraged to support Agile transformations and individual growth:

* **Mentoring Circles**: Mentoring circles bring together a group of mentees and one or more mentors for peer learning and support. The group dynamic fosters collaboration, shared learning, and diverse perspectives.

* **Coaching Agile Teams (CAT)**: The Coaching Agile Teams (CAT) framework focuses on coaching Agile teams and Scrum Masters. It provides guidance on coaching techniques, activities, and strategies that support team success and continuous improvement.
