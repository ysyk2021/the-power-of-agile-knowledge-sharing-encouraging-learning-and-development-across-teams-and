To measure the success of agile knowledge sharing initiatives, organizations can use the following KPIs:

### Improved Quality and Efficiency

Improved quality and efficiency are key indicators of successful agile knowledge sharing. This can include metrics such as reduced error rates, increased productivity, or faster time-to-market.
